# scrollable-gui
This class provides scrollable [GUI](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/Gui.htm) functionality for AutoHotkey v1 and v2 with dynamic size updates.  
It supports horizontal and vertical scrolling, and allows for customization of scroll behavior, including focus-based inner scrolling.  
A detailed user guide will be provided at a later date.  
For version-specific examples and integration code, refer to the `main-ahkv1` and `main-ahkv2` branches of this repository.
